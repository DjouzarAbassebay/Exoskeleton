Hand Exoskeleton to assess spasticity disorder

Spasticity is a serious disabling problem that translates into persistent muscle stiffness, spasms or sore contractions. It is a neurological problem generally caused by a stroke or other damages in the brain. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons more than 12 million people worldwide are affected by this pathology. However current assessment procedures such as the Tardieu Scale, are based on the appreciation of each physiotherapist, there is no standardized method of evaluation and not enough data for monitoring. On the other hand, exoskeleton devices hold a strong potential in providing accurate diagnostic using existing assessment methods.
